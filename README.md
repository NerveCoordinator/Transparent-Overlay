# Transparent-Overlay
Transparent click through overlay

Work in progress. 

Window manager matters: this should work in xmonad, seems okay in gnome, almost works in awesome, but i3 doesn't play nice with it.

It worked when I originally set up the code, but I've changed operating systems since then.

Make sure you have a compositor like compton running so transparency works.

TODO:
* get working again on my system
	* i3 full screen is grey
	* xmonad isn't booting, but need to retest it there
	* awesomewm and gnome offset window and click through fails
* find source of example code or remove it
* clean up 
* get it working on someone else's system booting fresh
* list required installs
